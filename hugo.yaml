      This blog is meant to document my experiments on Robotics, LLMs, Vision and other AI-related subjects. Project posts are written while I'm doing them so some might be finished and some might be waiting for completion. I hold a Master in Mechanical Engineering from UC Berkeley and now work as a Research Engineer on vision/diffusion models for self-driving at Helm.ai. I also do some research on the side at UC Berkeley's Hybrid Robotic Lab.
